# weather

Playing around with Node.js and NPM packages for server side web application development

## Server Side
* Using the `express` framework
* Database handled by `nedb`
* `node-fetch` for making api calls from within the server

## Client Side
* `Openstreetmaps` and `leaflet.js` for rendering the map

## API's Used
* Openweathermap for getting the weather data
* Openaq for getting the airquality data

### Usage
* Clone the repository.
* Rename the `.sample_env` file as `.env` and then add your api key for open weather map and then run using node
```node index.js```
